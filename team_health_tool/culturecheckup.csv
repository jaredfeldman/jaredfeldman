Only the most tangible things get acted upon; the entire team can strongly agree about something but nothing happens.
I would be afraid of mentioning failures because they might be met with frustration. Whereas I would prefer to directly talk about and bring up blockers we have or discuss options that may be imperfect on some dimensions, I have to weigh whether it's worth getting certain reactions. There's a feeling that we have to get things right the first time to be a high-performing team. That there isn't time for any other way.
While there is discussion between SM, QA, UI, and Service when committing work to ensure there is alignment and capacity, there is not much shared responsibility. While there is an interest in cross-training I am not aware of anyone who is learning something other than their function. Stepping outside of your functional area to contribute can be met with 'stay in your lane' type reactions. It makes it hard for us to swarm around a problem or point out different blindspots. Sometimes, especially in crunch time, one hand doesn't know what the other one does and so it can slow things down.
Silos do certainly exist and not only is it frowned upon to speak outside of your immediate official expertise but functional meetings are cloistered. It is very hard to get knowledge because the general idea is that other people don't need it. Directives will be passed down and you'll be given a user story and that's all you should need. So it's hard to be proactive, it's hard to really understand what the users and business need, and it's uncomfortable to try to be collaborative since that goes against the grain.
It is hard to access the business because our relationship with them is so tightly managed and treated very delicately to a fault. Without access to the business or users many of the decisions we are making are not based on data and so are arbitrary and so are not the most innovative. They may not meet a need nor create a strong experience. The business seems open to talking about more interesting ideas but we don't even let ourselves have that opportunity.
We are encouraged not to fail, so there is little risk-taking. We occasionally have research PBIs that the developers take on to understand what is possible which is a good first step. But we don't do things in an iterative way, we don't outline, record, and return to hypothesis for our work decisions are just made that we do not follow-up on. There's a sense that we need to move fast so we don't have time to work through some of these more collaborative, experimental, innovative methods but I think it comes at a cost.
There is little embrace of uncommon perspectives. Largely because in ceremonies only 4-5 people are actively engaged in the conversation beyond their immediate function whereas there are 15-20 people on the team. People are not made to feel it is an inclusive, safe space to contribute; or they do not have an interest to; or they have learned it is not their place/not necessary and probably are doing something else. Even if ideas are presented, it starts to feel like there is not any point because the response is often 'those are great ideas but' in a sort of dismissal rather than group conversation. Most significantly though, there is just not room for ideas. By the time things get down to us the decisions have already been made, even though there are a lot of holes in them and the team may not understand the backlog, so it takes a lot of energy and pushing to understand the background evidence and even come up with and suggest ideas because the whole time there's complaining of it taking too long. When there's resistance to just step back and look at the big picture in a white-boarding session, it's really just an uphill battle.
Ultimately the team accomplishes some work but its cohesion and culture are dysfunctional."

It is more motivated, with greater direction and better collaboration both within the team and with outside members.  A particular challenge for the team has been the cognitive dissonance caused by supporting legacy architecture while conversely undergoing transformations in the way the LATTE team works and how it fits into the Application Services broader transformation strategy.  I believe we have worked past that unnecessary conflict and may in fact be leading the way in some regards where process and team organization is concerned.   All in all - I am happy with where we are as compared to when we had a similar survey several months ago."

But, I feel there are some other topics that can be improved.  I feel the processes in place for taking on new work, deploying to prod, and fixing prod/QA issues all can have significant delays - which can lead to a lower level of customer satisfaction.  There have been many occasions where work/deployment was postponed so that we could follow the processes in place at that time.  It seems like customer satisfaction is not considered with as much importance as the process.  Additionally, I feel that sometimes work is postponed for longer periods of time than necessary...  since there are so many forms and approvals in the process, I get the impression than many people prefer delays in the project, rather than completing the forms and getting approvals.
Also, the HealthPlaNET architecture has become very complex, and contains many different components requiring different layers of expertise and teams.  With that complexity - when an unexpected/complicated issue arises, it has been time consuming to get all the necessary teams involved to investigate the issue.  In the QA environment, it has been difficult to determine who to contact for help."
