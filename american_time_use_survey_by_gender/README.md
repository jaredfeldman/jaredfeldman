In this project, we use the American Time Use Survey data to analyze how people of different sexes spend their time differently.

Guiding Questions

(1) Do people of different sexes spend time differently? Have the sex differences in time use changed over time? 

(2) What are the categories of activities that have the biggest difference in time spent between the sexes? 

(3) Were any of the differences in time spent on the activities between the sexes affected by COVID-19?
