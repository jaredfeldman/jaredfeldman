# Responsible AI: Proposed Comprehensive Incident Management Framework - Overview
## Abstract

As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become prevalent across various domains, the rise of AI-related incidents raises significant concerns regarding ethical implications, privacy threats, and organizational responses. This paper examines the landscape of AI incidents through the lens of the Artificial Intelligence Incident Database (AIID) and analyzes the accountability framework surrounding these incidents. The distributed responsibility inherent in the development of sociotechnical systems challenges traditional notions of assigning blame to individuals or organizations. The paper proposes a comprehensive approach to incident management, emphasizing learning, collaboration, and restorative justice. Additionally, it highlights the crucial role of ethics and privacy specialists within organizations and explores the possibility of AI product recalls in extreme cases.
