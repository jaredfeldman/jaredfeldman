# Differential Privacy in Facial Recognition - Overview

In this project, we implemented Discrete Cosine Transform and differential privacy to enhance facial recognition privacy, reproducing results from Ji et al. ([2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568494620306001)) and explored the balance between privacy preservation and utility.
